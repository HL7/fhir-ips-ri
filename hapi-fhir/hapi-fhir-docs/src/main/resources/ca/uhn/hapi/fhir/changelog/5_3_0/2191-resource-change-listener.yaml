title: "Added a new IResourceChangeListenerRegistry service and modified SearchParamRegistry and SubscriptionRegistry to use it.

        This service contains an in-memory list of all registered {@link IResourceChangeListener} instances along
        with their caches and other details needed to maintain those caches. Register an {@link IResourceChangeListener} instance
        with this service to be notified when resources you care about are changed. This service quickly notifies listeners
        of changes that happened on the local process and also eventually notifies listeners of changes that were made by
        remote processes."
